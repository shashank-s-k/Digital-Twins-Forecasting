# Digital Twins Forecasting

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores forecasting techniques using a dataset related to retail store inventory. The notebook demonstrates how AI-enhanced digital twins can optimize demand forecasting and inventory management.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle:
[Retail Store Inventory Forecasting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anirudhchauhan/retail-store-inventory-forecasting-dataset).

## Project Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand key patterns and trends.
- **Forecasting Techniques**: Apply machine learning models to forecast inventory demand.
- **Digital Twin Implementation**: Explore how digital twins can be used for virtual business operations.

## Key Steps in the Notebook

1. **Importing Libraries**: Includes all necessary Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
2. **Dataset Exploration**: Initial analysis of the dataset, including statistics and visualizations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transformation and preparation of the dataset for forecasting.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Applying and comparing forecasting models to optimize performance.
5. **Conclusion**: Insights from the models and their implications for business operations.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- darts (for time-series forecasting)

You can install these libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn darts
